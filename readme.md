## Hello World. This is my first repository. 

Here is some text. You can type anything here you would like.

Things I like to do in Berkeley: 

* Stay safe during qurantine 
* Cook tasty meals 
* Study hard for J-Rue's class 

My plans for the weekend are: 

1. Complete all of the assignements for J-Rue's class 
2. Double-check that I completed all of J-Rue's assignments. 
3. Triple-check that all assignments are done.
